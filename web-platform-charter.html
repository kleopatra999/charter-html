      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a> is to provide methods to continue the development of the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> language, providing specifications that enable
        improved client-side application development on the Web, including
         application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for client-side development and markup vocabularies for
          describing and controlling client-side application behavior.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The group will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue the development of the HTML language, and associated APIs.</li>
          <li>Ensure that developers can use Web technologies to build client-side applications that rely on Web engines as application runtime environments.</li>
          <li>Provide generic and consistent interoperability and integration among all target formats, such as HTML, CSS, and SVG.</li>
          <li>Continue to define normative requirements for applications that process HTML resources, including (but not limited to) browsers and other interactive user agents, as well as authoring tools, markup generators, and conformance checkers.</li>
          <li>Ensure universal access to Web applications across a wide range of devices and among a diversity of users, by addressing issues of accessibility, device independence, internationalization, and mobility.</li>
          <li>Ensure proper privacy and security reviews of its deliverables.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           The Web Platform Working Group should develop modular specifications to the greatest extent possible for the development of the HTML language, allowing extension specifications to define new elements, new attributes, new values for attributes that accept defined sets of keywords, and new APIs.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>The group will be considered successful if its deliverables are widely used. In particular:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items
      listed in the <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a> section.
      </li><li>A test suite for each deliverable with conformance criteria that provides evidence to support the position that there is good (though perhaps not perfect) interoperability.
      </li><li>Availability of authoring tools and validation tools.
      </li><li>User-community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.
      </li><li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable browser
        implementations of each deliverable. Remaining differences in implementations should have little impact on usage on the Web.
      </li><li>Specifications include normative conformance
        requirements for browser implementations.
      </li><li>Implementation reports that summarize the implementation status against
        the relevant test suite.
    </li></ul>
   <p>If participants from fewer than three distinct browser-engine
      projects are participating in the group, its charter should be
      re-examined by the W3C.</p>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

      </section>



      <section id="communication">
        <h2>
          Communication
        </h2>
        <p>The Working Group operates using a documented <a href="https://github.com/w3c/WebPlatformWG/blob/gh-pages/WorkMode.md">working
            mode</a>. In general
          the group does not hold plenary teleconferences, but does meet face to face at the
          TPAC. It may hold more meetings, and certain specifications are
          developed with regular teleconferences. Note the <a href="#decisions">Decision
            Policy</a> below with regards to meetings. </p>
        <p>
        The Working Group <strong>conducts its work primarily through <a href="https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/webplatform/repositories">GitHub repositories</a></strong>,
        for contributions and communications.
        Similar to open-source software development,
        peer production is encouraged: changes will be executed through Pull Requests, with pull requests reviewed before being merged.
        The Chairs must ensure that regular activity summaries around the GitHub repositories activity are provided.</p>
        <p>The Group may use mailing lists. Subscription
          to these lists is open to the public, subject to W3C norms of
          behavior. </p>
        <p>Up-to-date information about the group (for example, details about
          deliverables, issues, actions, status, and participants) is available from
          the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web
            Platform Working Group home page</a>.</p>

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>As explained in the W3C Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an
          editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then
          refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may put a question out for voting within the
          group  to allow for asynchronous participation, using the mechanism
          noted in the group's <a href="https://github.com/w3c/WebPlatformWG/blob/gh-pages/WorkMode.md">Work Mode</a>
          documents, and record a
          decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
          considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available.</p>
        <p><strong>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is
          to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the
          publication of the resolutions sent to the appropriate working
          group mailing list as described in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/WebPlatformWG/blob/gh-pages/WorkMode.md">Work Mode</a>
          documents. If no objections are raised on the mailing list
          within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.</strong></p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
            3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
          procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
